Mediator Pattern
================

When one object does something it can broadcast the information to all other objects under the same mediator.

Another example you can see on Company of Heroes, each squad is a mediator and each soldier in a colleague, when enemies are down the soldier tells the squad so they can move on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJCH467zf4w
