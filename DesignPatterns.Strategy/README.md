Strategy Pattern
================

This pattern assign a behavior to a class accordingly to the context.

The example from this project was inspired on Tyrant dragon from Breath of Fire IV. Each turn he changes his base element, so instead of having a big if/switch and assign all properties we can just make use of a behavior class to make it behave accordingly to the context.

This guy used a unit called "Valkirie" from Starcraft to demonstrate how this pattern can be applied to the unit movements.
